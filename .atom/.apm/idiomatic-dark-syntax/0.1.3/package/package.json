It seemed like just about every word was a different color; I found this rather distracting. So, I tried to limit this syntax theme to what are, in my view, just the essential highlighting rules. I think this makes the code easier to read and it looks nicer, too.\n\nOptimized for html, css (and less), javascript, go, and markdown.\n\nYou can also keep the minimal highlighting rules and just replace the colors in colors.less with your own dark palette.\n\nv0.1.3 should quiet the Deprecation Cop (for now).\n\n![idiomatic-dark_js](https://github.com/blaqbern/idiomatic-dark-syntax/blob/master/screenshot-js.png?raw=true)\n\n![idiomatic-dark_html](https://github.com/blaqbern/idiomatic-dark-syntax/blob/master/screenshot-html.png?raw=true)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/blaqbern/idiomatic-dark-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/blaqbern/idiomatic-dark-syntax#readme","_id":"idiomatic-dark-syntax@0.1.3","_shasum":"0b34a5715ef08977491edfa9ae872e7570c36ece","_resolved":"file:..\\d-1151024-10820-jfnacc\\package.tgz","_from":"..\\d-1151024-10820-jfnacc\\package.tgz"}

Works only with scss syntax.\n\n## Dependencies\n* node-sass library https://github.com/sass/node-sass\n\n## Modes\nAvailable two compiling file detection modes:\n* Base path is editor project.\n* Tries to extract current path from editable file. It will check if **inputPath** value are in editable file path, and it will be reference point for compiling `Scss` file. Aslo it could be specified based on reference point with **outputPathExtracted**.\n\n## Settings\n| Parameter           \t| Description                                    \t|\n|---------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t|\n| inputPath           \t| Specifies where the *Scss* files are stored. ( Path relative to your project ).                                    \t|\n| outputPath          \t| This specifies where the *CSS* will be saved. ( Path relative to your project ).                                   \t|\n| fileName            \t| *Scss* type file name, to be parent of all @include.                                                               \t|\n| outputStyle         \t| `String` to determine how the final *CSS* should be rendered. Its value should be one of `nested` or `compressed`. \t|\n| successMsg          \t| Eneable/disable success message.                                                                                   \t|\n| extractPath         \t| Eneable/disable - Get path from file. ( package tries to extract current path based on editable file and sets reference point ).                              \t|\n| inputPathExtracted  \t| Specifies where your *Scss* files are stored. ( Relative to extracted reference point ).                            \t|\n| outputPathExtracted \t| Specifies where the *CSS* will be saved. ( Relative to extracted reference point ).                                 \t|\n\n## Plans\n* Include `node-sass` in package dependencies to use apm node not local one.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/GomatoX/sass-compiler/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/GomatoX/sass-compiler#readme","_id":"sass-compiler@0.4.0","_shasum":"4c5616a3511d201d54aea2c284d16ac17b758848","_resolved":"file:..\\d-116018-10276-xbxm34\\package.tgz","_from":"..\\d-116018-10276-xbxm34\\package.tgz"}
